I initialized this repository only for personal use.
I'll test myself and practice what I've learned on this repository.
Most of the commits will be about my PracticeApp where I'll practice and see how things work in React Native
I will be testing and seeing how components work etc. most of this work will be useless for anyone but me. 

Well, have a nice day if you're reading this stuff!
